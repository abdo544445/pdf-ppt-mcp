# PDF/PPT MCP Explorer

Welcome to the **PDF/PPT MCP Explorer**! This is the official Visual Studio Code GUI wrapper for the popular `pdf-ppt-mcp` package.

## Features

- **Document Explorer:** Instantly find all supported documents (`.pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .csv`) cleanly categorized in a new sidebar tree view.
- **Copy Path for AI:** Copy well-crafted prompts with absolute paths for your AI assistant in one click.
- **Preview Document:** Right-click supported files to preview them in VS Code.
- **Auto-Configure Assistant:** Single-click configuration to inject the MCP Server directly into Cline or RooCode JSON configs!

## Requirements

You must have `pdf-ppt-mcp` installed as the backend for the AI. This extension manages that configuration automatically for you!

## Extension Settings

No complicated settings to manage. Everything works out-of-the-box in any opened workspace!
